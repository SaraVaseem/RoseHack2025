## Inspiration
Reading research papers is _very complicated and confusing_, therefore an website that can store your own personal library of research papers you want to use would be very handy!

## What it does
Input a link to an academic article and ReaDatPaper will read and summarize it for you. It will also provide relevant concepts and articles!

## How we built it
Build using Nextjs and Tailwindcss for the front end, and Flask for the back end. 
Using HuggingTree and GoogleSeach APIs for the AI summarization and related concepts.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out the most optimal design as well as using services and tools we have never used before. There was a lot of discussion and confusion since each of us had different ways to approach the problem. But overall communication was very productive and fostered a better understanding with what we were working with. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
With all of us being beginner hackers, this is our first ever hackathon,  and we are very proud of creating a full stack application for the first time in addition to using AI APIs. 

## What we learned
System design and planning is very important, as well communicating our idea. There was a lot of studying on how to use all the new tools we where introduced, but the exposure was worth it since it got us out of our comfort zones. 

## What's next for ReaDatPaper (read that paper)
Possibly a ReaDatPaper.v2 that is more refined and optimized.
